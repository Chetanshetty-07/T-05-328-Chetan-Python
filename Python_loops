LOOPS

Python offers 3 choices for running the loops. The basic functionality of all the techniques is the same,
although the syntax and the amount of time required for checking the condition differ.
We can run a single statement or set of statements repeatedly using a loop command.

The following sorts of loops are available in the Python programming language.
1.For Loop
2.While Loop


1.For Loop
The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence, which could be a list, tuple, array, or string.


Syntax:
for iterator_variable in sequence_name:
	Statements
	. . .
	Statements

Example: languages = ["Aventodor", "Chiron", "Evoque", "Ghost"]
         for language in languages:
              print(language)

          Output:Aventodor
                 Chiron
                 Evoque
                 Ghost

2.While loop
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE.
It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

Syntax:
while conditional_expression:
    Code block of while

The given condition, i.e., conditional_expression, is evaluated initially in the Python while loop.
Then, if the conditional expression gives a boolean value True, the while loop statements are executed.
The conditional expression is verified again when the complete code block is executed.
This procedure repeatedly occurs until the conditional expression returns the boolean value False.

Example:
    num =0
    while num < 5:
    num = num + 1
    print('num = ', num)
